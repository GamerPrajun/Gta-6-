Hello World ! I am making this repo to track my progress. 
I will be trying to earn 1 lakh the following year. I guess you already know the reason why.

So let's start with Day 1

* Day 1 - May 9 Friday

Meet you at Day 2, Bye :)

* Day 2 - May 10 Saturday
* I got the github student pack.
* I made accounts on upwork, fiverr and selected a profession, will work on it from tomorrow.
* I learned a little about figma and creating designs.
* Total - Rs 1400 // No change :(
